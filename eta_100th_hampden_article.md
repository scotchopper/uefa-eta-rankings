### **The Euro 2020 Dream:**

### **Goals That Made Us Roar:**
Over these 100 Hampden matches, we've witnessed some truly memorable goalscorers lighting up the national stadium. Leading the way at Hampden specifically is **John McGinn with 14 goals**, followed by **Kenny Miller (9 goals)** and **Scott McTominay (7 goals)** - showcasing different eras of Scottish attacking talent.

But let's not forget where it all began - **Eoin Jess** had the honor of scoring the first goal in ETA's era during that memorable **5-0 victory over San Marino**. From that moment to McGinn's recent strikes, the 139 goals scored at Hampden during the ETA era tell the story of Scotland's attacking evolution, with 59 different players finding the net at our national stadium, scoring 130 goals between them (with the remaining 9 coming from opponent own goals).
